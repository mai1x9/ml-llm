CVE: CVE-2024-9473
Name: GlobalProtect App: Local Privilege Escalation (PE) Vulnerability
Description: A privilege escalation vulnerability in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows allows a locally authenticated non-administrative Windows user to escalate their privileges to NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM through the use of the repair functionality offered by the .msi file used to install GlobalProtect.
Severity: 7.8 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5

CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux, GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

Existing credentials files that are exposed by this issue will be secured when the fixed GlobalProtect app is launched.
Workarounds: 
Users should not save their credentials until the GlobalProtect app is upgraded to a fixed version.

GlobalProtect portal administrators can prevent GlobalProtect app users from saving their credentials on the next connection to the GlobalProtect portal by preventing ‘Save User Credentials’ from the portal agent configuration as described here:

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux, GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

Existing credentials files that are exposed by this issue will be secured when the fixed GlobalProtect app is launched.
Workarounds: 
Users should not save their credentials until the GlobalProtect app is upgraded to a fixed version.

GlobalProtect portal administrators can prevent GlobalProtect app users from saving their credentials on the next connection to the GlobalProtect portal by preventing ‘Save User Credentials’ from the portal agent configuration as described here:

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues 

Prisma Access customers can open a support case to request an upgrade.

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues 

Prisma Access customers can open a support case to request an upgrade.

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues

Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues 

Prisma Access customers can open a support case to request an upgrade.

**Most Critical Actions to Address These Vulnerabilities:**

1. **Update Google Chrome**: Patch the browser to the latest version (131.0.6778.140 or later) to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
2. **Block Access to Crafted Content**: Implement content filters and security policies to block access to potentially malicious websites and files.
3. **User Training**: Educate users on safe browsing practices, such as avoiding suspicious websites and downloads.
4. **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in your infrastructure.
5. **Implement the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**: Limit user privileges to minimize potential damage if an attacker exploits a vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- Some CVSS scores might appear higher than expected due to the 'Attack Vector' (AV:N) being set to 'Network', indicating that an attack can come from the network, which is typically considered more severe.
- The list ranks vulnerabilities based on their CVSS score, but the actual risk may vary depending on your specific environment and threat model.

It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues

To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues 

Prisma Access customers can open a support case to request an upgrade.

CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux, GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

Existing credentials files that are exposed by this issue will be secured when the fixed GlobalProtect app is launched.
Workarounds: 
Users should not save their credentials until the GlobalProtect app is upgraded to a fixed version.

GlobalProtect portal administrators can prevent GlobalProtect app users from saving their credentials on the next connection to the GlobalProtect portal by preventing ‘Save User Credentials’ from the portal agent configuration as described here:

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues 

Prisma Access customers can open a support case to request an upgrade.

CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux, GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

Existing credentials files that are exposed by this issue will be secured when the fixed GlobalProtect app is launched.
Workarounds: 
Users should not save their credentials until the GlobalProtect app is upgraded to a fixed version.

GlobalProtect portal administrators can prevent GlobalProtect app users from saving their credentials on the next connection to the GlobalProtect portal by preventing ‘Save User Credentials’ from the portal agent configuration as described here:

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux, GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

Existing credentials files that are exposed by this issue will be secured when the fixed GlobalProtect app is launched.
Workarounds: 
Users should not save their credentials until the GlobalProtect app is upgraded to a fixed version.

GlobalProtect portal administrators can prevent GlobalProtect app users from saving their credentials on the next connection to the GlobalProtect portal by preventing ‘Save User Credentials’ from the portal agent configuration as described here:

Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux, GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

Existing credentials files that are exposed by this issue will be secured when the fixed GlobalProtect app is launched.
Workarounds: 
Users should not save their credentials until the GlobalProtect app is upgraded to a fixed version.

GlobalProtect portal administrators can prevent GlobalProtect app users from saving their credentials on the next connection to the GlobalProtect portal by preventing ‘Save User Credentials’ from the portal agent configuration as described here:

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues 

Prisma Access customers can open a support case to request an upgrade.

Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 6.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS, GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS, and all later GlobalProtect app versions with the ‘force-disable-sso’ app setting.

Set ‘force-disable-sso’ to ‘yes’ to prevent unintended transmission of the local user credentials as described here:

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 6.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

Set ‘force-disable-sso’ to ‘yes’ to prevent unintended transmission of the local user credentials as described here:

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 6.5 (Medium)

Set ‘force-disable-sso’ to ‘yes’ to prevent unintended transmission of the local user credentials as described here:

Response:
The analysis reveals several common themes across the provided CVE data related to Google Chrome:

1. **Insufficient Data Validation**: A recurring theme is vulnerabilities due to insufficient data validation, leading to potential privilege escalation or data leakage. This affects various UI areas such as DevTools, Inspectors, Utils, and even Windows systems.

2. **Exploitation Through Crafted Inputs**: Vulnerabilities often stem from crafted HTML pages or malicious files that bypass data validation mechanisms, allowing attackers to exploit these gaps for arbitrary code execution or data exposure.

3. **Focus on Specific UI Components**: The issues are concentrated in specific browser components like DevTools, Inspectors, Utils, and even Windows-based utilities (e.g., Data Transfer). This indicates targeted vulnerabilities within these interfaces.

4. **OS-Level Exploitation**: Some vulnerabilities manifest as OS-level privilege escalation, affecting Windows versions of Chrome across different UI sections.

These patterns suggest that Google Chrome has multiple entry points for attackers to exploit by leveraging validation gaps in its various components and interfaces. Addressing these vulnerabilities would require comprehensive fixes across these affected areas.

        If no CVEs match, say "No relevant vulnerabilities found".
Response:
Let's analyze the provided CVE data to identify trends and patterns. Here's what we can observe:

**Product:**

* The overwhelming majority of CVEs affect **Google Chrome**. This is expected as you specifically requested analysis based on Google Chrome CVEs.

**Severity:**

* A significant portion of vulnerabilities are categorized as **High Severity (8.8)**, indicating a substantial potential impact.
* There are also numerous **Medium Severity (4.3-7.8)** vulnerabilities, highlighting the ongoing need for security patching and updates.

**CWE IDs:**

* The most common CWE IDs present are:
    * **CWE-345**: Insufficient data validation
    * **CWE-416**: Use after free
* These indicate recurring weaknesses in how Google Chrome handles user input and memory management, respectively.

**Vulnerability Types:**


* **Insufficient Data Validation:** This is a major theme across many CVEs (e.g., CVE-2024-3172, CVE-2024-9963, CVE-2024-7979). Attackers exploit this to manipulate data inputs, potentially leading to code execution, privilege escalation, or information leaks.
* **Use After Free:**  This error occurs when software attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential crashes, allowing attackers to execute malicious code (e.g., CVE-2024-6103, CVE-2024-5831).
* **Inappropriate Implementation:**  These vulnerabilities arise from design flaws in how features are implemented. For example, CVE-2023-4909 relates to obfuscating security UI elements, potentially misleading users about the true state of a website.

**Recommendations:**


* **Prioritize Patching:** Regularly update Google Chrome to the latest version to address known vulnerabilities.
* **Secure User Input:** Be cautious when interacting with websites and avoid entering sensitive information on untrusted sites.

* **Use Security Extensions:**  Consider using browser extensions that enhance security, such as those that block malicious scripts or warn about suspicious websites.

        CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 6.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues 

Prisma Access customers can open a support case to request an upgrade.
Workarounds: 
Change the following two settings (if enabled) to "Allow with Ticket":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Disable GlobalProtect App
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow user to disconnect GlobalProtect App

Change the following setting (if enabled) to "Disallow":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Uninstall GlobalProtect App

        If no CVEs match, say "No relevant vulnerabilities found".
Response:
The potential impacts of the identified vulnerabilities on the **GlobalProtect** app and **Google Chrome** are significant, as several of these vulnerabilities pose serious security risks related to privilege escalation, unauthorized access, and system compromise.

---

### **GlobalProtect App Vulnerabilities**

1. **CVE-2022-0018**
   - **Impact**: This vulnerability allows a local user with legitimate credentials to transmit their username and password to an arbitrary global user during the Single Sign-On (SSO) process when the "Force Connect" option is enabled.
   - **Fix**: Disabling the "Force Connect" feature if the local user is trusted. This could lead to unauthorized access of sensitive data by a third party.

2. **CVE-2024-0016 and CVE-2023-0015**
   - **Impact**: This vulnerability allows a local user with legitimate credentials to transmit their username, plaintext/encrypted password, and encrypted session ID to the GlobalProtect portal when authenticated users connect via the app. Attackers could use this information to impersonate the target user.
   - **Fix**: The only mitigation is to stop using the "Force Connect" feature.

3. **CVE-2022-0016 and CVE-2023-0015**
   - **Impact**: A local user can gain privileges in the GlobalProtect app when connecting via Connect Before Login with users from different organizations.
   - **Fix**: Preventing the transmission of plaintext credentials. This could grant attackers access to sensitive system files.

4. **CVE-2024-9473**
   - **Impact**: Attackers can impersonate a trusted global user who has configured their portal settings and gain access to internal user credentials.
   - **Fix**: No immediate workarounds, but ensuring that trusted users do not have portal settings enabled.

5. **CVE-2023-1089**
   - **Impact**: Global users with trusted configurations can expose internal credentials during the portal configuration phase.
   - **Fix**: Disabling "Force Connect" to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

6. **CVE-2024-8687, CVE-2023-532, and CVE-2024-1019**
   - **Impact**: Vulnerabilities in the app configuration could allow attackers to manipulate internal settings or data.
   - **Fix**: No specific workarounds provided.

---

### **Google Chrome Vulnerabilities**

The provided vulnerabilities for Google Chrome are from the Chromium project and include issues such as heap corruption, use-after-free memory, CRIME attacks, and other high-impact security flaws. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain remote access to systems or data.

---

### **Overall Concerns**
- **GlobalProtect App**: The high-impact vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-0018, CVE-2024-0016/2023-0015) are particularly concerning as they allow unauthorized access to sensitive data and system privileges. Users should ensure that these vulnerabilities are fixed immediately.
- **Google Chrome**: While many of the Chrome vulnerabilities are high severity, some (like CVE-2024-8687, 9473, 532, etc.) could also pose significant risks through browser exploitation.

---

### **Recommendations**
1. For **GlobalProtect App Users**:
   - Apply all recommended fixes for the identified vulnerabilities.
   - Ensure that "Force Connect" is disabled to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Monitor system logs and ensure that trusted users do not have portal settings enabled (for CVE-2024-9473).
   - Consider additional security measures such as password complexity requirements or rate limiting during SSO.

2. For **Google Chrome Users**:
   - Apply the recommended fixes for identified vulnerabilities to reduce risks.
   - Stay updated with Chromium updates and patches.

If you have specific concerns about how these vulnerabilities might be exploited, feel free to ask for further clarification!

        CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 6.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS, GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS, and all later GlobalProtect app versions with the ‘force-disable-sso’ app setting.

Set ‘force-disable-sso’ to ‘yes’ to prevent unintended transmission of the local user credentials as described here:

CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux, GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

Existing credentials files that are exposed by this issue will be secured when the fixed GlobalProtect app is launched.
Workarounds: 
Users should not save their credentials until the GlobalProtect app is upgraded to a fixed version.

GlobalProtect portal administrators can prevent GlobalProtect app users from saving their credentials on the next connection to the GlobalProtect portal by preventing ‘Save User Credentials’ from the portal agent configuration as described here:

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues 

Prisma Access customers can open a support case to request an upgrade.
Workarounds: 
Change the following two settings (if enabled) to "Allow with Ticket":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Disable GlobalProtect App
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow user to disconnect GlobalProtect App

Change the following setting (if enabled) to "Disallow":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Uninstall GlobalProtect App

        CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration.

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux, GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

Existing credentials files that are exposed by this issue will be secured when the fixed GlobalProtect app is launched.
Workarounds: 
Users should not save their credentials until the GlobalProtect app is upgraded to a fixed version.

GlobalProtect portal administrators can prevent GlobalProtect app users from saving their credentials on the next connection to the GlobalProtect portal by preventing ‘Save User Credentials’ from the portal agent configuration as described here:

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues 

Prisma Access customers can open a support case to request an upgrade.
