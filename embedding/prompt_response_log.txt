CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux, GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

Existing credentials files that are exposed by this issue will be secured when the fixed GlobalProtect app is launched.
Workarounds: 
Users should not save their credentials until the GlobalProtect app is upgraded to a fixed version.

GlobalProtect portal administrators can prevent GlobalProtect app users from saving their credentials on the next connection to the GlobalProtect portal by preventing ‘Save User Credentials’ from the portal agent configuration as described here:

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues 

Prisma Access customers can open a support case to request an upgrade.
Workarounds: 
Change the following two settings (if enabled) to "Allow with Ticket":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Disable GlobalProtect App
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow user to disconnect GlobalProtect App

Change the following setting (if enabled) to "Disallow":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Uninstall GlobalProtect App

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
