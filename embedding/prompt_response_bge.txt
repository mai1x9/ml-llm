        CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux, GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

Existing credentials files that are exposed by this issue will be secured when the fixed GlobalProtect app is launched.
Workarounds: 
Users should not save their credentials until the GlobalProtect app is upgraded to a fixed version.

GlobalProtect portal administrators can prevent GlobalProtect app users from saving their credentials on the next connection to the GlobalProtect portal by preventing ‘Save User Credentials’ from the portal agent configuration as described here:

CVE: CVE-2021-3057
Name: GlobalProtect App: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability When Connecting to Portal or Gateway
Description: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app that enables a man-in-the-middle attacker to disrupt system processes and potentially execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.9 on Windows; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.8 on Windows; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.8 on the Universal Windows Platform; GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.1 on Linux.
Severity: 9.3 (Critical)
CVSS: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.9 on Windows, GlobalProtect app 5.2.8 on Windows and on Universal Windows Platform, GlobalProtect app 5.3.1 on Linux, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.
Workarounds: 
There are no known workarounds for this issue.

CVE: CVE-2022-0021
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Using Connect Before Logon
Description: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows that logs the cleartext credentials of the connecting GlobalProtect user when authenticating using Connect Before Logon feature. This issue impacts GlobalProtect App 5.2 versions earlier than 5.2.9 on Windows. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)

-----
CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 6.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS, GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS, and all later GlobalProtect app versions with the ‘force-disable-sso’ app setting.

Set ‘force-disable-sso’ to ‘yes’ to prevent unintended transmission of the local user credentials as described here:

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues 

Prisma Access customers can open a support case to request an upgrade.
Workarounds: 
Change the following two settings (if enabled) to "Allow with Ticket":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Disable GlobalProtect App
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow user to disconnect GlobalProtect App

Change the following setting (if enabled) to "Disallow":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Uninstall GlobalProtect App

        CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 6.5 (Medium)

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues 

Prisma Access customers can open a support case to request an upgrade.
Workarounds: 
Change the following two settings (if enabled) to "Allow with Ticket":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Disable GlobalProtect App
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow user to disconnect GlobalProtect App

Change the following setting (if enabled) to "Disallow":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Uninstall GlobalProtect App

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 6.5 (Medium)

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues

Based on the provided CVE data, here are mitigation recommendations for your specific GlobalProtect version (5.2.5):


**High Priority:**

* **CVE-2022-0019 (GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability)**
    * Upgrade to GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 or later on Linux, and GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 or later on Windows and macOS. This fixes the vulnerability directly.

* **CVE-2024-8687 (PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes)**
    * Upgrade both your GlobalProtect app deployments *and* your PAN-OS software to fixed versions following the instructions provided in the CVE description.

* **CVE-2023-0009 (GlobalProtect App: Local Privilege Escalation (PE) Vulnerability on Windows)**
    * Upgrade to GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, 6.0.5, or 6.1.1 for immediate remediation.


**Medium Priority:**

* **CVE-2022-0021 (GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure When Using Connect Before Logon)**
    * Upgrade to GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows. There are no known workarounds.

* **CVE-2022-0018 (Information exposure vulnerability when connecting with Single Sign-On Enabled)**
    * Upgrade GlobalProtect app to 5.1.10, 5.2.9 or later. Set the ‘force-disable-sso’ app setting to ‘yes’ as a temporary workaround if immediate upgrade is not possible.

* **CVE-2023-5475 (Inappropriate implementation in DevTools) & CVE-2023-4904 (Insufficient policy enforcement in Downloads)**
    * These vulnerabilities impact older versions of Google Chrome, which may be relevant depending on your browser usage and configuration.

**Google Chrome Specific Mitigations:**

While these mitigations are not directly applicable to GlobalProtect itself, they address vulnerabilities that could affect the security of your overall system:


* **Upgrade Google Chrome**: Regularly updating Google Chrome to the latest stable release is crucial for addressing known vulnerabilities.
* **Disable Unused Extensions**: Remove or disable browser extensions you don't actively use to minimize potential attack surfaces.

**General Best Practices:**


* Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.

* Keep all software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware, up-to-date with the latest security patches.

* Regularly review user privileges and access controls to ensure they are appropriate for their roles.
* Conduct periodic security assessments and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.

CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux, GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

Existing credentials files that are exposed by this issue will be secured when the fixed GlobalProtect app is launched.
Workarounds: 
Users should not save their credentials until the GlobalProtect app is upgraded to a fixed version.

GlobalProtect portal administrators can prevent GlobalProtect app users from saving their credentials on the next connection to the GlobalProtect portal by preventing ‘Save User Credentials’ from the portal agent configuration as described here:

Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux, GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

Existing credentials files that are exposed by this issue will be secured when the fixed GlobalProtect app is launched.
Workarounds: 
Users should not save their credentials until the GlobalProtect app is upgraded to a fixed version.

GlobalProtect portal administrators can prevent GlobalProtect app users from saving their credentials on the next connection to the GlobalProtect portal by preventing ‘Save User Credentials’ from the portal agent configuration as described here:

Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)

Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

CWE IDs: CWE-367
-----
CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 6.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS, GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS, and all later GlobalProtect app versions with the ‘force-disable-sso’ app setting.

Set ‘force-disable-sso’ to ‘yes’ to prevent unintended transmission of the local user credentials as described here:

CVE: CVE-2024-32002
Name: Git's recursive clones on case-insensitive filesystems that support symlinks are susceptible to Remote Code Execution
Description: Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, repositories with submodules can be crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/` directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed while the clone operation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. If symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work. As always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.

### **Recommended Countermeasures**

#### **For Palo Alto GlobalProtect App**
1. **Apply Security Patches**  
   - Update GlobalProtect versions 5.2 and above (all Windows versions) on all devices using the exact update instructions provided in the respective CVE descriptions.
   
2. **Avoid Using CBL**  
   - Discourage users from connecting to the app via CBL unless they have legitimate access, as it bypasses security controls.

3. **Implement Account Restrictions**  
   - For Windows versions affected by certain vulnerabilities (e.g., saving passwords or using 'Save User Credentials'), implement account restrictions or non-username accounts for users who log on via the app to prevent unauthorized access.

4. **Monitor GlobalProtect Portals**  
   - Use user account permissions and restrict access if users save their GlobalProtect credentials, as this could allow unauthorized use of sensitive information.

5. **Limit Login History**  
   - Prevent users from saving login history or passwords in the portal unless explicitly requested for legitimate purposes only.

---

#### **For Chrome**
1. **Apply Security Updates**  
   - Upgrade to the latest version of Chrome (e.g., 123.0.6312.105) on Windows, macOS, and Linux to patch vulnerabilities related to command execution, compositing, and user account storage.

2. **Monitor for Malicious Extensions**  
   - Keep Google Chrome updated to protect against vulnerabilities in the Extensions API (e.g., use after free in extensions or malicious scripts).

3. **Update Global Protect App on Multiple Platforms**  
   - Apply patches to GlobalProtect versions 5.2 and above on all affected devices, including mobile browsers.

4. **Disable Symbolic Links if Untrusted Sources Are Used**  
   - For Git vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2024-3174), configure Git to disable symbolic links or use trusted sources where possible.

---

#### **For Windows Users**
1. **Update GlobalProtect App Regularly**  
   - Always ensure GlobalProtect versions 5.2 and above are installed on all devices, as patched versions include security fixes for CBL vulnerabilities.

2. **Implement Account-Based Security**  
   - Use unique credentials for each user account to minimize unauthorized access if users log in via the app.

3. **Disable Account Restrictions Where Possible**  
   - Remove or limit account restrictions (e.g., non-username accounts) to allow proper system-wide use of GlobalProtect features unless absolutely necessary.

---

#### **For Network Administrators**
1. **Monitor Logins and Permissions**  
   - Log all globalprotect logins and ensure they meet legitimate requirements only, especially if user accounts are saved or configured via the app.

2. **Review Account Usage Patterns**  
   - Conduct regular audits to check for unauthorized use of GlobalProtect features or access to restricted areas.

3. **Patch Infrastructures Early**  
   - Ensure that globalprotect-infrastructure services (e.g., portals) are patched as soon as vulnerabilities are identified.

CWE IDs: CWE-367
-----
CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE: CVE-2024-32002
Name: Git's recursive clones on case-insensitive filesystems that support symlinks are susceptible to Remote Code Execution
Description: Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, repositories with submodules can be crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/` directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed while the clone operation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. If symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work. As always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE: CVE-2024-32002
Name: Git's recursive clones on case-insensitive filesystems that support symlinks are susceptible to Remote Code Execution
Description: Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, repositories with submodules can be crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/` directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed while the clone operation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. If symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work. As always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 6.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE: CVE-2024-32002
Name: Git's recursive clones on case-insensitive filesystems that support symlinks are susceptible to Remote Code Execution
Description: Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, repositories with submodules can be crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/` directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed while the clone operation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. If symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work. As always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.

CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

Existing credentials files that are exposed by this issue will be secured when the fixed GlobalProtect app is launched.
Workarounds: 
Users should not save their credentials until the GlobalProtect app is upgraded to a fixed version.

GlobalProtect portal administrators can prevent GlobalProtect app users from saving their credentials on the next connection to the GlobalProtect portal by preventing ‘Save User Credentials’ from the portal agent configuration as described here:

Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H

It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues

Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 6.5 (Medium)

Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS, GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS, and all later GlobalProtect app versions with the ‘force-disable-sso’ app setting.

Set ‘force-disable-sso’ to ‘yes’ to prevent unintended transmission of the local user credentials as described here:

CVE: CVE-2024-32002
Name: Git's recursive clones on case-insensitive filesystems that support symlinks are susceptible to Remote Code Execution
Description: Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, repositories with submodules can be crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/` directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed while the clone operation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. If symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work. As always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.

Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 6.5 (Medium)

Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS, GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS, and all later GlobalProtect app versions with the ‘force-disable-sso’ app setting.

Set ‘force-disable-sso’ to ‘yes’ to prevent unintended transmission of the local user credentials as described here:

CVE: CVE-2024-32002
Name: Git's recursive clones on case-insensitive filesystems that support symlinks are susceptible to Remote Code Execution
Description: Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, repositories with submodules can be crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/` directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed while the clone operation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. If symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work. As always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.

CVE: CVE-2024-32002
Name: Git's recursive clones on case-insensitive filesystems that support symlinks are susceptible to Remote Code Execution
Description: Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, repositories with submodules can be crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/` directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed while the clone operation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. If symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work. As always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues 

Prisma Access customers can open a support case to request an upgrade.
Workarounds: 
Change the following two settings (if enabled) to "Allow with Ticket":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Disable GlobalProtect App
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow user to disconnect GlobalProtect App

Change the following setting (if enabled) to "Disallow":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Uninstall GlobalProtect App

CVE: CVE-2024-32002
Name: Git's recursive clones on case-insensitive filesystems that support symlinks are susceptible to Remote Code Execution
Description: Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, repositories with submodules can be crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/` directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed while the clone operation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. If symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work. As always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues 

Prisma Access customers can open a support case to request an upgrade.
Workarounds: 
Change the following two settings (if enabled) to "Allow with Ticket":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Disable GlobalProtect App
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow user to disconnect GlobalProtect App

Change the following setting (if enabled) to "Disallow":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Uninstall GlobalProtect App

CVE: CVE-2024-32002
Name: Git's recursive clones on case-insensitive filesystems that support symlinks are susceptible to Remote Code Execution
Description: Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, repositories with submodules can be crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/` directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed while the clone operation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. If symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work. As always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues 

Prisma Access customers can open a support case to request an upgrade.
Workarounds: 
Change the following two settings (if enabled) to "Allow with Ticket":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Disable GlobalProtect App
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow user to disconnect GlobalProtect App

Change the following setting (if enabled) to "Disallow":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Uninstall GlobalProtect App

CWE IDs: CWE-787
-----
CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux, GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

Existing credentials files that are exposed by this issue will be secured when the fixed GlobalProtect app is launched.
Workarounds: 
Users should not save their credentials until the GlobalProtect app is upgraded to a fixed version.

GlobalProtect portal administrators can prevent GlobalProtect app users from saving their credentials on the next connection to the GlobalProtect portal by preventing ‘Save User Credentials’ from the portal agent configuration as described here:

CWE IDs: CWE-522
-----
CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 6.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues

CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux, GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

Existing credentials files that are exposed by this issue will be secured when the fixed GlobalProtect app is launched.
Workarounds: 
Users should not save their credentials until the GlobalProtect app is upgraded to a fixed version.

GlobalProtect portal administrators can prevent GlobalProtect app users from saving their credentials on the next connection to the GlobalProtect portal by preventing ‘Save User Credentials’ from the portal agent configuration as described here:

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 6.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS, GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS, and all later GlobalProtect app versions with the ‘force-disable-sso’ app setting.

Set ‘force-disable-sso’ to ‘yes’ to prevent unintended transmission of the local user credentials as described here:
https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/globalprotect/10-1/globalprotect-admin/globalprotect-apps/deploy-app-settings-transparently/customizable-app-settings/app-behavior-options.html

-----
CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues 

Prisma Access customers can open a support case to request an upgrade.
Workarounds: 
Change the following two settings (if enabled) to "Allow with Ticket":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Disable GlobalProtect App
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow user to disconnect GlobalProtect App

Change the following setting (if enabled) to "Disallow":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Uninstall GlobalProtect App

CVE: CVE-2022-0019
Name: GlobalProtect App: Insufficiently Protected Credentials Vulnerability on Linux
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 5.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux, GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

Existing credentials files that are exposed by this issue will be secured when the fixed GlobalProtect app is launched.
Workarounds: 
Users should not save their credentials until the GlobalProtect app is upgraded to a fixed version.

GlobalProtect portal administrators can prevent GlobalProtect app users from saving their credentials on the next connection to the GlobalProtect portal by preventing ‘Save User Credentials’ from the portal agent configuration as described here:

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
Severity: 6.5 (Medium)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS, GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS, and all later GlobalProtect app versions with the ‘force-disable-sso’ app setting.

Set ‘force-disable-sso’ to ‘yes’ to prevent unintended transmission of the local user credentials as described here:
https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/globalprotect/10-1/globalprotect-admin/globalprotect-apps/deploy-app-settings-transparently/customizable-app-settings/app-behavior-options.html

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

To maintain the ability for end users to use the uninstall password feature and the disable or disconnect passcode feature, you must ensure that you upgrade all GlobalProtect app deployments to a fixed version before you upgrade your PAN-OS software to a fixed version.

All fixed versions of GlobalProtect are backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of PAN-OS software. However, fixed versions of PAN-OS software are not backwards compatible with vulnerable versions of GlobalProtect.

You can find additional information for PAN-204689 here:  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-release-notes/pan-os-11-1-0-known-and-addressed-issues/pan-os-11-1-0-known-issues 

Prisma Access customers can open a support case to request an upgrade.
Workarounds: 
Change the following two settings (if enabled) to "Allow with Ticket":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Disable GlobalProtect App
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow user to disconnect GlobalProtect App

Change the following setting (if enabled) to "Disallow":
* Network > GlobalProtect > Portals >  > Agent >  > App > Allow User to Uninstall GlobalProtect App

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

CVE: CVE-2024-8687
Name: PAN-OS: Cleartext Exposure of GlobalProtect Portal Passcodes
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables a GlobalProtect end user to learn both the configured GlobalProtect uninstall password and the configured disable or disconnect passcode. After the password or passcode is known, end users can uninstall, disable, or disconnect GlobalProtect even if the GlobalProtect app configuration would not normally permit them to do so.
Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

Severity: 7.1 (High)
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
Product: GlobalProtect
Affected Versions: 5.2.5
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.25, PAN-OS 9.0.17, PAN-OS 9.1.16, PAN-OS 10.0.12, PAN-OS 10.1.9, PAN-OS 10.2.4, PAN-OS 11.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions. It is also fixed in Prisma Access 10.2.9 and all later Prisma Access versions. To maintain GlobalProtect app functionality for the vulnerable features, we released a corresponding software update for GlobalProtect app 5.1.12, GlobalProtect app 5.2.13, GlobalProtect app 6.0.7, GlobalProtect app 6.1.2, and GlobalProtect app 6.2.1, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

CVE: CVE-2022-0018
Name: GlobalProtect App: Information Exposure Vulnerability When Connecting to GlobalProtect Portal With Single Sign-On Enabled
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
