Vulnerabilities:
Name: Git's recursive clones on case-insensitive filesystems that support symlinks are susceptible to Remote Code Execution
Severity: 9
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
Threat Level: Critical
Mitigation: 
Affected Systems:
- Product: Git, Version: 2.37.3, Vendor: The Git Development Community
Description: Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, repositories with submodules can be crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/` directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed while the clone operation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. If symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work. As always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.

https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/globalprotect/10-1/globalprotect-admin/globalprotect-apps/deploy-app-settings-transparently/customizable-app-settings/app-behavior-options.html
Workarounds: 
There are no known workarounds for this issue.
Affected Systems:
- Product: GlobalProtect, Version: 5.2.5, Vendor: Palo Alto Networks
Description: An information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows and MacOS where the credentials of the local user account are sent to the GlobalProtect portal when the Single Sign-On feature is enabled in the GlobalProtect portal configuration. This product behavior is intentional and poses no security risk when connecting to trusted GlobalProtect portals configured to use the same Single Sign-On credentials both for the local user account as well as the GlobalProtect login. However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit. This vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations. Fixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS; GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.

Threat Level: Medium
Mitigation: This issue is fixed in GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux, GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux, and all later GlobalProtect app versions.

Existing credentials files that are exposed by this issue will be secured when the fixed GlobalProtect app is launched.
Workarounds: 
Users should not save their credentials until the GlobalProtect app is upgraded to a fixed version.

GlobalProtect portal administrators can prevent GlobalProtect app users from saving their credentials on the next connection to the GlobalProtect portal by preventing ‘Save User Credentials’ from the portal agent configuration as described here:

https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/globalprotect/10-1/globalprotect-admin/globalprotect-apps/deploy-app-settings-transparently/customizable-app-settings/user-behavior-options.html
Affected Systems:
- Product: GlobalProtect, Version: 5.2.5, Vendor: Palo Alto Networks
Description: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Linux that exposes the hashed credentials of GlobalProtect users that saved their password during previous GlobalProtect app sessions to other local users on the system. The exposed credentials enable a local attacker to authenticate to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway as the target user without knowing of the target user’s plaintext password. This issue impacts: GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than and including GlobalProtect app 5.2.7 on Linux. GlobalProtect app 5.3 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.3.2 on Linux. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.
